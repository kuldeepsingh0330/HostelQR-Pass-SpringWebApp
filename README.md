# QrHostel Pass

Qr Hostel Pass is a web application designed to provide an efficient and streamlined process for 
managing the permissions of hostlers leaving and returning to the hostel. With the growing number 
of hostlers in many hostels, it has become increasingly challenging for hostel management to 
monitor and manage the permissions of hostlers who leave and return to the hostel. This is where 
the Qr Hostel Pass application comes in.


The application generates a unique QR code for each hostler, which is then scanned by the 
gatekeeper to grant permission for leaving the hostel. When the hostler returns, the same QR code 
is scanned to expire the permission. This helps to ensure that only authorized hostlers are leaving 
and entering the hostel, which enhances the overall security of the hostel.


In addition to the QR code generation functionality, the application also provides an activity list 
page where employees and hostlers can view their activities. This feature helps to keep track of 
who is leaving and entering the hostel and provides an easy way to monitor the activities of the 
hostlers. The activity list page can be filtered by date and time, making it easy to view activities 
over a specific period.


The Qr Hostel Pass application is built using the Spring MVC framework, Spring Core, Hibernate, 
JDBC, and a MySQL database. The ZXing library is used for QR code generation, and the 
application is implemented using Servlets and JSP. The application provides a user-friendly 
interface that is easy to navigate, making it easy for hostlers and employees to use.


Overall, the Qr Hostel Pass application provides a convenient and efficient way to manage the 
permissions of hostlers leaving and returning to the hostel. The application has the potential to 
significantly improve the process of granting and monitoring permissions, making it a valuable 
tool for hostel management.
